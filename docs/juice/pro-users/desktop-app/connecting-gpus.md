# Connecting Your GPUs

Juice will show no available GPUs or application sessions to join the first time you start the application, unless you are invited to join an existing pool. To start a session, you'll need to connect your machine's available GPUs.

Selecting filters lets you specify the number of available GPUs in each workstation and how much memory each GPU has, making it much easier to search for available GPUs.
