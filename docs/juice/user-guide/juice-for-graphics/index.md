# Juice for Graphics

These examples assume that you are running from a command prompt or shell with the `juice` executable available in the path, e.g. with the directory you extracted the Juice client archive to listed in the `PATH` environment variable.

The graphics examples must be run on Windows, as Juice currently does not support graphics workloads from Linux clients. This is only a client-side restrictionâ€”the Juice server runs equally well on Windows and Linux, and clients from either OS can connect to servers running on either OS
